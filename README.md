## For Encrypt

To **Encrypt** a folder or file

For folders (_you must type the path as it appears in your file browser_)

![PATH](https://i.imgur.com/Lah8Ri8.png)

For only files (_one or more files_)

Only select the files to encrypt.

supports = jpg, png, mp3, mp4, docx, xlsx, sql, py, zip, etc...

**Enter a password:**

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> The password cannot contain the characters $ or "" and ''
> The password will not be visible while you type it.

When you click the Encrypt button, the operation will begin., it will start encrypting the files with the extension **".gie"** and will generate a **".GKY"** file, which is very important to decrypt your original file.

*"GKY" is the extension of the file containing the key for decryption, along with the password provided.*

! *If you want to share the file with your colleague, you will need to provide him/her with three files, the .gie, the .GKY and the password.*

**EXAMPLE**

## For Decrypt

To **Decrypt** a folder or file 

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> The password must be the same as the one used to encrypt the file, otherwise you will lose your file forever.

The program will search if the .GKY file exists in the path provided and will try to decrypt the file with the password, if the password does not match the file will not decrypt or will decrypt corruptly, if the GKY does not exist, the program will throw an error message and will not be able to decrypt.

It is very important to save the .GKY and the PASSWORD very well.
